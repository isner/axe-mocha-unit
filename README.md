# Using aXe in Mocha Unit Tests

This example shows you how to use aXe with the Mocha unit testing framework.

## Configuring the test

* Node must be installed; please follow the directions at [http://www.nodejs.org](http://www.nodejs.org) to install it.
* `npm install` to install dependencies.

## Running the test

* `npm test` to run the Mocha unit test

You should see output indicating that the tests ran successfully, with zero failures. Optionally, you can `console.log` the aXe results set to see what failed.
